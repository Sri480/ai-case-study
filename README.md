## AREA OF INTEREST:  FINANCE


## Overview and Origin

**What is the company AlphaSense about?**

**AlphaSense** provides a platform to provide insights and help professionals make smarter business decisions by sifting through vast amounts of financial data using Machine Language and Natural Language Processing.

AlphaSense was launched in 2011 by Jack Kokko and Raj Neervannan. The idea was  born when Jack, as a investment banking analyst in Silicon Valley, had to manually research the hard way, working with large number of documents searching with one keyword at a time. Years later, as a Wharton Executive MBA student, Jack realized the research process was just as cumbersome and research tools were just as outdated. At Wharton, Jack met his co-founder Raj Neervannan and founded AlphaSense to provide a new type of search engine utilizing Artificial intelligence.

## Business Activities

The core product of AlphaSense is its **AI-powered search and discovery platform for Finance**. AlphaSense utilizes Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to allow for easy extraction of insights from a vast array of sources and data points. This assists professionals to make smarter business decisions. 

AlphaSense has over 4000 enterprise clients including hedge funds and other investment firms.  As per a quote from Jack: “We have hundreds of algorithms that are reading every line of text and categorizing information. So our system knows what company or companies are being talked about in a given document, what industry it’s about based on the language, and many other things that help you quickly narrow down your search to a given industry, to a specific set of companies.”

AlphaSense has used artificial intelligence technologies for over ten years. It uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. AlphaSense is now also using large language models and is now developing its own large language models (LLMs). It recently launched its first Generative AI application, Smart Summaries, which provides summaries of content such as earnings calls.


## Landscape

AlphaSense is in the business of providing AI powered financial research in the areas of Enterprise intelligence, Expert Insights, Wall Street Insights.  They provide access to content like Broker and Independent Research, Expert Transcript Library, Company Documents, News, Regulatory and Internal Content.

As the field of AI has mushroomed over the past few years, the landscape of financial research has changed along with it. While research was pretty manual 10 years ago (and still continues to be, in many cases), there have been attempts by numerous companies to use the latest technologies like AI to bring this research to our finger tips with minimal interaction and maximum relevant content. This is mainly by making the computers smarter through Machine Learning, Reinforced Learning, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. Information is Power and Data is King. By using vast amounts of data in the public space for training, data can be converted to meaningful information which can be offered to the public at a price. 

The latest trend in AI is Generative AI and the use of Large Language Models. Information can now be presented in a more concise and relevant manner and tailored based on context.

One of the direct competitors to AlphaSense is Bloomberg which is also investing heavily in Generative AI and has announced BloombergGPT, an LLM for finance. Bloomberg plans to integrate BloombergGPT into its terminal software. Other competitors in this space include Thomson Reuters Eikon, FactSet. In May 2022, AlphaSense acquired competitor Sentieo.

AlphaSense is a leader in the field of AI-powered financial search and analytics. While Bloomberg Terminal is widely used in the financial industry and is known for providing real-time and end-of-day feeds and pricing, it can be complex and may lack advanced AI-driven capabilities. FactSet has a comprehensive coverage of financial data but it too may lack the advanced NLP technology employed by AlphaSense. Many indicators suggest AlphaSense is on a good growth trajectory and has raised several rounds of funding including $125 million in 2021. It has a growing customer base and continues to innovate and expand its project offerings. The company has received Industry Recognition and appears poised to solidify its position among financial professionals.


## Recommendations

>1. AlphaSense offers its services based on a subscription-based model. While this is useful for organizations, especially integrating with thrid party software and APIs, this is not user-friendly for a first-time  user or a potential future customer. Even though there is a free trial, it is not seamless. Currently we get a message *"Please fill out the form below and an AlphaSense team member will be in touch within 20 minutes to help set up your trial."* Integrating a seamless web-based interface with limited free options for all would greatly benefit the company, much like OpenAI's ChatGPT. This provides convenience and more visibility into potential benefits offered by the company. Also providing some services for free would bring more traffic to this site and make it more popular amongst finance professionals. AI technologies like Natural Language Processing (which is already used in its core products) can be leveraged for its free web based interface.
>
>2.  Another recommendation is for AlphaSense to leverage AI and machine learning capabilities to provide personalized investment advice for individual investors. Individual investors do not have access to all the market research available to large corporations or hedge funds who can employ specialists to do the research for them. Personal investment advice for free or a minimal fee would be an excellent way to draw more traffic to this site and be of benefit to the community.
